## Hi there, I'm Madeline 👋

I am a software engineer with experience in web development (front-end and back-end), general purpose programming, and database  architecture. I like working on projects that challenge me as a developer and push me to learn new tools, strategies, and design. My current focus is in the area of API development and web crypto.
