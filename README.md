## Hi there, I'm Madeline 👋

I am a software engineer with experience in web development (front-end and back-end), general purpose programming, and database  architecture. I like designing software solutions for real-world problems, and I always look for ways that I can improve my approach. Lately I've been focused on strengthening my knowledge of cryptography and API development.
